# Production System Monitor
Built a monitoring framework for running scripts against production systems to check that every step is running as expected.

Uses a modular structure to add and remove sections to allow new areas to be monitored on the fly.

Currently used by the Application Support team at Octopus Labs to check Windows services status', check databases, and also logg into specific systems to check that they are operational.
